"This is my final message to the world. I really wish there was someone out there who could understand me, the pain and torment I have been going through. It hurts so much that I can't stand another second living in this world. I plan on killing myself, I feel empty inside."
"This is the worst day of my life, my broke my wrist the other day, and today I witnessed something terrible in hospital."
I love how Elon Musk is buying out every company out there. It is crazy!
"I'm feeling very tired nowadays, my head hurts constantly, not a great day today."
"Why is Twitter such an awesome platform. I can just type stuff and press enter then boom, everyone sees it!"
"I'm feeling dizzy for some reason, my dead dog is running around the backyard.  I think I'm halluncinating."
Why is it so cold outside. I can't walk out without feeling the wind slicing my skin.
Good morning.
"Went to therapy for a few weeks, I feel good and refreshed"
"I tried talking to my friends, it hasn't really helped, hopefully putting out my thoughts here can make at least a little difference"
"I hate myself, I really do, my self-esteem is so low and I don't know what to do about it."
Why does life feel so meaningless. I spend my time blanking out with no motivation whatsoever.
"I played that new video game that came out, oh my god it is so addicting yall should try."
"No one laughed at my terrible joke, I'll work on it don't worry guys."
"Why is the plural of Goose, geese, but for moose, its just moose not meese?"
Cryptocurrency is a SCAM! DON'T DO IT!
"Walking on the beach, looking at the deep, vast, dark ocean. I wonder how it is to drown in those depths."
"Thinking about my dog, everytime I see her, I just flat out cry."
"I tried that new chick-fil-a sandwich, mmm that stuff was crazy delicious holyy."
"I love hackathons, coding makes me feel so inspired and meeting new teammates is one of the best parts of it."
Brushed my teeth wondering if my dog will jump at me as she sees me awake. Nothing was the same.
"My dog died, I didn't have the energy to even tweet anything yesterday, I'm just so sad."
"Did you see that shooting star yesterday, I wished for a good day tomorrow, let us see if it is."
Hello this is my first ever tweet.
